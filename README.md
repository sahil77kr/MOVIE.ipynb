MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

This project tackles the multi-label classification problem of predicting movie genres from plot summaries. The dataset contains textual descriptions of movies, which are transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. For classification, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained to handle the sparse and high-dimensional text features effectively. The model outputs one or more genres for each movie, such as Action, Comedy, Drama, etc. Evaluation metrics include micro and macro averaged Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, suitable for multi-label classification tasks.
